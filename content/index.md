## What is Hoopla
Hoopla is a digital collection platform that allows anyone who attains a public library card access to their resources. While not entirely public to everyone, it is still a digital collection that many libraries provide with their library card. I personally, have used Hoopla with both Brazoria County and El Paso public library cards.

### Recourses
Hoopla provides many different recourses to include audiobooks, eBooks, music, TV shows, and movies. The primary recourses highlighted by many of the libraries are the audiobooks and eBooks. Hoopla organizes the resources with a *Home, Movies, Television, Bingepasses, and Music* pages. The *home* page includes trending eBooks, audiobooks, and comics. Later down the page, it offers trending movies and television.

### Purpose
The purpose of Hoopla is mostly entertainment, but could also be used for research. Hoopla can provide entertainment through reading books/comics, listening to books, watching television/movies, or listening to music. The platform can reach all different types of audiences ranging from those just interested in listening to music to bookworms seeking their next thrilling novel. The second available purpose of Hoopla can be greatly useful to students or those trying to increase their knowledge. Students can easily access the app or website in order to attain required readings needed for school or optional readings to help with the understanding of subjects.
