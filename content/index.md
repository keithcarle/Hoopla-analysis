## What is Hoopla
Hoopla is a digital collection platform that allows anyone who attains a public library card access to their resources. While not entirely public to everyone, it is still a digital collection that many libraries provide with their library card. I personally, have used Hoopla with both Brazoria County and El Paso public library cards.

### Recourses
Hoopla provides many different recourses to include audiobooks, eBooks, music, TV shows, and movies. The primary recourses highlighted by many of the libraries are the audiobooks and eBooks. Hoopla organizes the resources with a *home, movies, television, binge passes, and music* pages. The *home* page includes trending eBooks, audiobooks, and comics. Later down the page, it offers trending movies and television.
