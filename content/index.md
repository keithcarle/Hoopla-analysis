## What is Hoopla
Hoopla is a digital collection platform that allows anyone who attains a public library card access to their resources. While not entirely public to everyone, it is still a digital collection that many libraries provide with their library card. I personally, have used Hoopla with both Brazoria County and El Paso public library cards.
